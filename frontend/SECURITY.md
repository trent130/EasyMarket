## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Reporting Process

1. **Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Instead, please send an email to security@example.com. 
   - If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key (available upon request).

3. Please include the following information in your report:
   - Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

4. Allow up to 48 hours for an initial response to your report. We will keep you informed about the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

### What to expect

- We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.
- After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed about the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
- We will treat your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission.

### Bug Bounty Program

At this time, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. We are grateful for your efforts in improving the security of our project and will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
