# Data Export

This document describes the data export functionality implemented in our application, which allows users to download their personal data in compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

## Overview

The data export feature enables users to request and download a copy of their personal data stored in our system. This promotes transparency and gives users control over their information.

## Features

1. Request data export
2. Generate exportable data
3. Secure download of exported data
4. Audit logging of export requests

## Process

### Requesting Data Export

1. User navigates to their profile or account settings page
2. User selects the "Download My Data" or "Export Data" option
3. System initiates the data export process

### Generating Exportable Data

The system collects and compiles the following types of data (if available):

- User profile information
- Account activity logs
- User-generated content
- Preferences and settings
- Third-party app authorizations

### Data Format

The exported data is provided in a JSON format for easy readability and parsing.

### Secure Download

1. System generates a unique, time-limited download link
2. User receives a notification (e.g., email) with the secure download link
3. User clicks the link to download their data
4. The link expires after a set period or after successful download

## Security Considerations

- Data is encrypted during the export process
- Download links are secure, time-limited, and single-use
- Users must be authenticated to request and download their data
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse of the export feature

## Audit Logging

Each data export request and download is logged for security purposes. The log includes:

- Timestamp of the request
- User ID
- IP address of the requester
- Status of the export (requested, generated, downloaded)

## API Endpoint

The data export feature is accessible via an API endpoint. For detailed information about this endpoint, please refer to the [API Documentation](../api/README.md#data-export).

## User Interface

In the user interface, the data export option is typically located in the user's profile or account settings page. It is presented as a button or link labeled "Download My Data" or "Export My Data".

## Limitations

- Large data exports may take some time to generate
- There may be a cooldown period between data export requests to prevent system abuse
- Certain types of data may be excluded from the export for privacy or security reasons (e.g., encrypted data, data related to other users)
