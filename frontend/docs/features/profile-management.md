- WebAuthn (for supported devices)

### Process

2. User can enable/disable 2FA
3. When enabling, user chooses the 2FA method
4. System guides the user through the setup process
5. User can generate backup codes for account recovery

## View and Revoke Third-Party App Access

Users can view which third-party applications have access to their account and revoke access if needed.

### Process

1. User navigates to the third-party app section
2. System displays a list of authorized applications
3. User can revoke access for any application
4. System confirms the action and removes the application's access

## Download User Data

Users can request a download of their account data for portability and transparency.

### Process

1. User requests to download their data

3. User downloads the file

## Delete Account

Users can choose to delete their account and all associated data.

### Process

1. User requests account deletion
2. System asks for confirmation
3. If confirmed, the system schedules the account for deletion
4. After a grace period (e.g., 14 days), the account and all associated data are permanently deleted

## Security Considerations

- All profile changes require re-authentication
- Sensitive actions (e.g., changing email, enabling/disabling 2FA) require additional verification
- Account deletion has a grace period to prevent accidental or malicious deletions
