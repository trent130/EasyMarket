# Third-Party App Management

This document describes the third-party app management functionality implemented in our application, which allows users to control access to their account by external applications.

## Overview

The third-party app management feature enables users to view, authorize, and revoke access for external applications that integrate with our system. This promotes transparency and gives users control over their data and account access.

## Features

1. View authorized third-party apps
2. Revoke access for specific apps
3. Authorize new third-party apps
4. Detailed access information for each app

## Process

### Viewing Authorized Apps

1. User navigates to their account settings or a dedicated "Connected Apps" page
2. System displays a list of all third-party apps currently authorized to access the user's account

### Revoking Access

1. User selects the "Revoke Access" option next to an authorized app
2. System prompts for confirmation
3. If confirmed, the system immediately revokes the app's access tokens
4. The app is removed from the list of authorized apps

### Authorizing New Apps

1. User initiates the authorization process from a third-party app
2. User is redirected to our application's authorization page
3. System displays information about the app and the permissions it's requesting
4. User reviews and approves (or denies) the access request
5. If approved, the system generates and provides access tokens to the third-party app

### Detailed Access Information

For each authorized app, the system displays:
- App name and logo (if available)
- Date of authorization
- Scope of access (e.g., read profile, post updates)
- Last access date (if available)

## Security Considerations

- Access tokens are securely stored and encrypted
- Revoked tokens are immediately invalidated
- Users are notified via email when a new app is authorized or when access is revoked
- Regular audits are performed to detect and remove unused or suspicious authorizations

## OAuth 2.0 Implementation

Our third-party app integration uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol:

1. Authorization Request: The third-party app redirects the user to our authorization endpoint
2. User Authentication: The user logs in to our system (if not already logged in)
3. Application Authorization: User reviews and approves the requested permissions
4. Authorization Grant: Our system issues an authorization code to the third-party app
5. Access Token Request: The third-party app exchanges the authorization code for an access token
6. API Access: The third-party app uses the access token to make API requests on behalf of the user

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are related to third-party app management:

- GET /api/user/authorized-apps: List all authorized apps for the current user
- POST /api/oauth/authorize: Authorize a new third-party app
- DELETE /api/user/revoke-app-access: Revoke access for a specific app

For detailed information about these endpoints, please refer to the [API Documentation](../api/README.md#third-party-apps).

## User Interface

In the user interface, the third-party app management feature is typically located in the user's account settings or a dedicated "Connected Apps" or "Authorized Applications" page. It presents a list of authorized apps with options to view details and revoke access.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Users cannot modify the scope of access for an app after authorization (they must revoke and re-authorize)
- There may be a limit to the number of third-party apps that can be authorized per user account
- Some core integrations or system apps may not be revocable by the user
