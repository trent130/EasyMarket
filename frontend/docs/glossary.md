# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for common terms used throughout the documentation of our authentication system.

## A

### Access Token
A credential used by an application to access an API. It represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data.

### Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity.

### Authorization
The process of granting or denying access rights and permissions to resources.

## B

### Bcrypt
A password hashing function designed to be slow and resist rainbow table attacks.

### Brute Force Attack
An attempt to guess a password or encryption key by systematically trying every possible combination.

## C

### CAPTCHA
A type of challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human.

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
An attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.

## D

### Data Export
A feature that allows users to download a copy of their personal data stored in the system.

## E

### Encryption
The process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.

## F

### Factor (in Multi-Factor Authentication)
A category of credential used for authentication. Common factors are something you know (like a password), something you have (like a phone), and something you are (like a fingerprint).

## G

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
A regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area.

## H

### Hashing
The process of converting input data into a fixed-size string of bytes, typically for the purpose of data integrity verification or password storage.

### HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
A web security policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

## J

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
A compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

## M

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
An authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource.

## O

### OAuth
An open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

## P

### Password Reset
A feature that allows users to regain access to their account by setting a new password, typically via email verification.

## R

### Rate Limiting
The practice of limiting the number of requests a sender can make to a receiver in a given time frame.

### Refresh Token
A special kind of token used to obtain a renewed access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

## S

### Salt
Random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase.

### Session
A temporary and interactive information interchange between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user.

## T

### TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
A temporary passcode that is computed using a secret key and the current time.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
A subset of multi-factor authentication, which requires exactly two different factors of authentication.

## W

### WebAuthn (Web Authentication)
A web standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows servers to register and authenticate users using public key cryptography instead of a password.
