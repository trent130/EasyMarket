# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in our application to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Authentication

1. **Password Hashing**: All user passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a cost factor of 12.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Users can enable 2FA using TOTP or WebAuthn.
3. **Session Management**: We use secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management.
4. **Account Lockout**: After 5 failed login attempts, the account is temporarily locked for 30 minutes.

## Authorization

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different user roles (e.g., user, admin) have different levels of access.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and processes are given the minimum levels of access necessary.

## Data Protection

1. **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data is encrypted in the database using AES-256.
2. **Encryption in Transit**: All communications use TLS 1.3 or higher.
3. **Data Minimization**: We only collect and retain necessary user data.

## API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**: API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse.
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
3. **OAuth 2.0**: We use OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization of third-party applications.

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Firewall**: A web application firewall (WAF) is in place to filter malicious traffic.
2. **Regular Updates**: All systems and dependencies are regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and real-time monitoring are in place to detect and alert on suspicious activities.

## Compliance

1. **GDPR Compliance**: We adhere to GDPR requirements, including the right to data portability and the right to be forgotten.
2. **Privacy by Design**: Security and privacy considerations are built into the system architecture and development process.

## Secure Development Practices

1. **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo peer review before being merged.
2. **Static Analysis**: Automated static analysis tools are used to identify potential security issues in the code.
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scans are performed to identify and update dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response

1. **Incident Response Plan**: A documented plan is in place for responding to security incidents.
2. **Regular Drills**: The team regularly conducts security incident response drills.

## User Education

1. **Security Guidelines**: Users are provided with guidelines for secure account management.
2. **Transparency**: We maintain transparency about our security practices and promptly notify users of any security incidents that may affect them.

## Third-Party Security

1. **Vendor Assessment**: All third-party services undergo a security assessment before integration.
2. **Limited Access**: Third-party services are given only the necessary level of access to function.

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Regular Audits**: We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
2. **Threat Modeling**: We perform threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
