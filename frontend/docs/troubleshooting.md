# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues that users and developers might encounter when working with our authentication system.

## User Authentication Issues

### 1. Unable to Log In

**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid credentials" error message
- Unable to access the account despite entering correct credentials

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Incorrect email or password**
   - Double-check the email address and password
   - Use the "Forgot Password" feature to reset the password if unsure

2. **Account not verified**
   - Check email for a verification link
   - Request a new verification email from the login page

3. **Account locked due to too many failed attempts**
   - Wait for the lockout period to end (usually 30 minutes)
   - Contact support if the issue persists

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Unable to receive or enter 2FA code
- 2FA code is always invalid

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Time synchronization issue**
   - Ensure the device's time is correctly synchronized
   - For TOTP: Try generating a new code after syncing time

2. **Incorrect 2FA setup**
   - Verify that the 2FA was set up correctly
   - If using an authenticator app, ensure the correct account is selected

3. **Lost access to 2FA device**
   - Use one of the backup codes provided during 2FA setup
   - Contact support for assistance in disabling 2FA

## API Integration Issues

### 1. "Unauthorized" Error When Making API Requests

**Symptoms:**
- Receiving a 401 Unauthorized response from the API

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Invalid or expired access token**
   - Ensure the correct access token is being used
   - If expired, use the refresh token to obtain a new access token

2. **Incorrect Authorization header format**
   - Verify the header format: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

3. **Insufficient permissions**
   - Check if the user has the necessary permissions for the requested resource

### 2. Rate Limiting Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Receiving a 429 Too Many Requests response

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Exceeding rate limits**
   - Implement proper request throttling in your application
   - Review your API usage and optimize if necessary

2. **Shared IP address being rate-limited**
   - If on a shared hosting, consider upgrading to a dedicated IP

## Data Export Issues

### 1. Data Export Taking Too Long

**Symptoms:**
- Data export request seems to be stuck or taking an unusually long time

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Large amount of data**
   - For large accounts, exports may take several hours. Be patient.
   - Check the status of the export using the provided API endpoint

2. **System overload**
   - Try requesting the export during off-peak hours

### 2. Incomplete or Corrupted Export Data

**Symptoms:**
- Downloaded data is incomplete or cannot be opened

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Download interrupted**
   - Ensure stable internet connection and try downloading again

2. **File corruption during transfer**
   - Verify file integrity using provided checksum (if available)
   - Request a new data export

## Third-Party App Integration Issues

### 1. Unable to Authorize Third-Party App

**Symptoms:**
- Authorization process fails or hangs

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Incorrect OAuth configuration**
   - Verify client ID and secret are correct
   - Ensure redirect URIs are properly set

2. **Permissions issue**
   - Check if the requested scopes are approved for the application

### 2. Third-Party App Loses Access

**Symptoms:**
- Third-party app suddenly unable to access the API

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**
1. **Access token expired**
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanism in the third-party app

2. **User revoked access**
   - Prompt user to re-authorize the application

3. **Changed API permissions**
   - Review any recent changes to API access or permissions

## General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check system status**
   - Verify if there are any ongoing system issues or maintenance

2. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
   - This can resolve many front-end related issues

3. **Use incognito/private browsing mode**
   - Helps isolate browser extension or caching issues

4. **Check for client-side console errors**
   - Use browser developer tools to identify JavaScript errors

5. **Verify API endpoint URLs**
   - Ensure you're using the correct API version and endpoints

6. **Review recent changes**
   - If the issue started recently, review any recent code or configuration changes
